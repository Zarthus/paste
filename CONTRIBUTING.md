# How to contribute

Thanks for reading this and I hope you contribute to paste! It takes some work off of my plate!

If you haven't joined the Discord, [please do so](https://discord.gg/EnqSwJK)! I'd love to hear from
you and help you with any contributions or issues.

## Pull requests

It's basically the best thing ever that you're making a PR. It warms the cockles of my heart.

All I ask is that you test your contribution (and when we have unit tests, add those), follow the
code style, and preferably use the [angular.js commit message format](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits).

Chances are that I will review it and request changes. GitHub represents that with a nasty red
cross, but I prefer to think of it as a yellow thumbs up. Together we can make an awesome
contribution!

## Issues

Use GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/jkcclemens/paste/issues) for paste. Search it for
open *and* closed issues to make sure you're not making a duplicate issue!

### Security concerns

**STOP!** Do *not* make an issue for security concerns that can be exploited! Please, see paste.gg's
[security.txt](https://paste.gg/.well-known/security.txt) for contact information regarding security
concerns.

### Bugs

Found a bug in paste? Feel free to drop an issue. Please include a description of how to reproduce
it (if possible) in detail. Include routes visited, inputs used, etc. Please also include both the
server and resources versions of paste (found in the footer on any page).

### Features

Do you think paste is missing a feature? Let me know! Just make an issue with your request, the
idea, and why it'd be useful. If you're really awesome, you can even start outlining how to
implement it.
